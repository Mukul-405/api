General Observations
Each endpoint behaves differently in terms of output format:

/v1: Word-like patterns.
/v2: Alphanumeric combinations.
/v3: Complex patterns with special characters.

There is no strict rate limiting observed; however, introducing a delay (e.g., 100ms) between requests is recommended to avoid overloading the server.
Results vary significantly depending on the input query.
